== Intro ==
After completing tic tac toe in C, I thought a good basic C project would be to code a todo list in C.
I am hoping to learn:
- State management in C: how to add/save/complete items

== Features == 
- Add items to todo list
- View items to todo list
- Complete items on todo list
- Delete items on todo list
- Remember items of todo list after closing 

== Road map ==
[x] Added menu list
[x] Save function
[x] Add task
[x] Delete task
[x] Complete task
[x] View tasklist

== Next sprint ==
[] Have todo list be displayed as a default instead of an action
[] Undo actions [D] / [X] ->[ ]
[] allow for task list to hold more than 9 tasks (99 tasks would be good)
