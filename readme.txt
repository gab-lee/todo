== Intro ==
After completing tic tac toe in C, I thought a good basic C project would be to code a todo list in C.
I am hoping to learn:
- State management in C: how to add/save/complete items

== Features == 
- Add items to todo list
- Load items in todo list
- Complete items on todo list
- Remember items of todo list after closing
